=head1 index

Setup the scope and forwards

Overwrite L<pfappserver::Base::Controller::Crud::Fingerbank::index> because we don't want "upstream" scope with Combinations

=cut

sub index {
    my ( $self, $c ) = @_;

    $c->stash(
        scope                   => 'Local',
        fingerbank_configured   => fingerbank::Config::is_api_key_configured,
        action                  => 'list',
    );
    $c->forward('list');
